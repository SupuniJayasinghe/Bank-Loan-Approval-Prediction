# Bank Loan Approval Prediction :bank:

This is a machine learning project built as a part of my 5th semester. It's about predicting bank loan approvals using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.

## Project Description :page_facing_up:

The Bank Loan Approval Prediction system is designed to predict whether a bank loan will be approved or not based on various factors like credit history, loan amount, income, etc. The system uses Logistic Regression and Decision Trees algorithms for prediction.
